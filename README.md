# Chatty-Bot
Program Description
This is a Python program that simulates a chatbot that can perform some basic operations, such as greeting the user, guessing their age, counting to any number, testing their programming knowledge, and saying goodbye.

The program starts by greeting the user and asking for their name. It then proceeds to guess the user's age based on remainders of dividing their age by 3, 5 and 7. After that, it counts to any number entered by the user. Then the program tests the user's programming knowledge with a question and four options, and will not stop until the user provides the correct answer. Finally, the program says goodbye to the user.

How to Use
To use this program, simply run the Python script. You can modify the greet function to change the name of the chatbot and the year it was created. The remind_name function prompts the user to enter their name, while guess_age attempts to guess the user's age based on remainders entered by the user. The count function counts to any number entered by the user. The test function tests the user's programming knowledge with a question and four options, and will only stop when the correct answer is provided. The end function simply says goodbye to the user.

Example
Here's an example of how to use this program:

Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> John
What a great name you have, John!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
> 1
> 2
> 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
> 5
0 !
1 !
2 !
3 !
4 !
5 !
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Please, try again.
